    content: `**_Welcome_** to the development blog for __Specter Ridge__! I am _Resonance Game Studios_ a one man studio based in Seattle, WA, and I'm working on a cozy mystery RPG set in the pacific northwest. I'm excited to share this story with you and can't wait to unveil more of the progress I have been making on Specter Ridge in the past few months.

The story begins with you, the player, arriving after a catastrophic mineshaft collapse that killed most of the residents of Specter Ridge. Now, you've arrived to a _literal_ ghost town. What secrets will you find within the mines? What mysteries are there to uncover in this town?

Follow along as I build a world that blends the warm, inviting atmosphere of personal favorite games like **[Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)** and **[Slime Rancher](https://www.slimerancher.com/)** with an mysterious narrative that pulls you in the more you discover about the town. I'll be sharing development updates, concept art, gameplay mechanics, and the stories behind Specter Ridge and it's residents throughout it's development!

I'll see you again real soon!
